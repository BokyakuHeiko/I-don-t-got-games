# I don't got games
**I don't got games** is an extension that immediately redirects you to **Never Gonna Give You Up** by **Rick Astley** every time you enter **IGG** (*or, I Got Games*) piracy website

An very useful extension that leaves you far away from a website that puts adware in your computer, redirects you to adult websites and distribute private information of other competitors

# Why IGG?
Well, for starters, *IGG Games* is a piracy website with a ton of weird adult ads, and sometimes they even add their own watermark to games

But they're also despised for doxxing and taking down what seemed to be an beloved piracy website called **Good Old Downloads**
I didn't got to see at real time, because I am not a person that is like, the piracy master, but still marks the unprofessionalism of **IGG**, but what could we expect from a piracy site?

And also, why not block a piracy website? if you're a "compulsive pirater" (*or whatever is the name, piracy addiction? probably does not really exist*) this will probably help you from not getting 40 malwares in one click


Not pirating things is actually a way better solution then entering any website with *free downloads* on it.
